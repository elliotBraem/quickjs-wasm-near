QuickJS for WebAssembly on NEAR protocol
========================================

QuickJS compiled to WebAssembly and a Web application for creating NEAR smart contracts in Javascript to run on smart contract VMs created with near-js-sdk.

[near-sdk-js](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js>) makes it possible to deploy Javascript smart contracts on NEAR protocol.

This web application let you write, simulate, deploy and call your javascript smart contracts in the web browser.                    

Note: Currently you can only create low-level ( [see examples here](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js/tree/master/examples/low-level) ) contracts from here.
